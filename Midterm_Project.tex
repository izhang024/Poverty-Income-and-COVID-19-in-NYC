\abstract{The purpose of this project is to determine the correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and economic inequalities in New York City. Although the phrase ``COVID-19 does not discriminate" is repeated on various occasions, the disease affects economically disadvantaged people disproportionately, reinforcing and exacerbating the economic inequalities in society through lack of access to resources. The COVID-19 pandemic increases concerns centering around lack of access to safe housing, food, and medical resources, which targets the less privileged group in society. This project projects the relationship between the number of positive cases of coronavirus and average rent in NYC from early 2020 to Spring 2022. Initial results show that the cases in poorer neighborhoods grow faster than in wealthier neighborhoods.

The project \emph{\textbf{Poverty, Income, and COVID-19 in New York City}} will focus on the relationship between the cases of coronavirus and the economic factors in New York City. Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought both positive and negative changes to society, influencing over 70 million people. In the city of New York, these changes hit hard on people who are less privileged and completely altered their way of living. This project will look into the average rent in New York City before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it to case rates in each neighborhood, analyzing the connections between the spread of virus and the economic advantages. 
\section{Prerequisites}

The project works with public accessible data sources, details will be provided in the bibliography section. The project also requires the 2022.1 version of Tableau Desktop. Visualization of case rates trend and average rent trend will be created by Tableau to analyze the correlation of poverty and spread of COVID-19.

\section{Methodology}

The methodology in this project includes two parts: pre-processing and methods. Pre-processing cleans out any useless data to enhance performance, and the visualizations are made following steps in methods.

\subsection{Pre-processing}

A preliminary processing of data is done at first in order to prepare the data sets for primary processing and further analysis. Methods for data pre-processing include data cleaning, data integration, data reduction, and data transformation. During the data selection period, the focus was on the completeness and inclusiveness on topics for each data sets, i.e., the complete list of daily case rates by zip-code is chosen over list of monthly case rates by boroughs.  The data file containing case rates by MODZCTA contains columns such as ``CASERATE\textunderscore 10001". Such column names are altered by eliminating ``CASERATE\textunderscore" to keep only the clean zip-code. The original data set is up to date, which is then cut short to fit the narrative of the research time frame. Similar actions are performed on the median income data set to clean up column names and unwanted areas. 

\subsection{Methods}

The visualizations are created with Tableau. After importing the first data source of case rate by MODZCTA, a new data set of median income data is connected with a common factor of zip-code.

\end{figure}


\section{initial results}
Both figure 3 and figure 4 are outside sources, where figure 3 confirmed my hypothesis of the high positive test rates in under-privileged neighborhoods. Figure 4 is a visualization of the median income in NYC. An new version of this visualization will be updated. The [figure 2]visualization represents COVID-19 case rates in NYC, in the week ending with April 3rd, 2022. The density of color represents the case rates per 100,000 people, darkest being the most severe. One thing I notice about this graph is that this map looks similar to the average income choropleth map of NYC. Neighborhoods with higher case rates are also neighborhoods with higher median incomes. 

%% if specified like this the section will be committed in review mode
\section{future work}{
The project needs improvement on the following:
\item[choropleth map]{Finish my second choropleth map (representing median income), combine choropleth maps together, adding interactions for user to choose from which map to view.}
\item[work on bar charts]{work on bar charts to represent case rates, make sure bar charts are appropriately sorted and labeled}
